# Experimental React site

This site will eventually host a few tools for the online MMORPG
[Hyperiums][hyps] - but it's mostly an experiment to build a pure-JS site.

It uses React for the frontend (built entirely of components, as inspired by
[Red Badger's site][rb-next] and has an express backend.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repo
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm start`
4.  Open http://localhost:8080/
